# UE23CS352A-ML-Offshore-Sediment-Classification
Machine Learning mini-project (UE23CS352A) for classifying offshore seabed sediments using XGBoost based on particle size parameters. Implements two-stage prediction — gravel detection and Folk’s sediment class classification — with evaluation using confusion matrix and ternary diagrams.
